A collection of polyfills (And a few primitive prototype helper functions that I hacked in)


#Date#

codePointAt: ES6 method for handling two character ASCII codes

#String#

next:  cheater method for Futures that calls setTimeout for your Function with the requested wait time

defer: cheater method like next, but will return a deferred that will resolve when your function's return Promise is resolved
